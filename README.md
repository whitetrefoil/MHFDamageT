This project is **NOT** my original project.  The original project is located here: http://homepage2.nifty.com/ferias/damage/damageT.htm

I have played MHFO for several years, and I really love this tool.  So I decide to clone one as a practice about using JS on special web application.

My Japanese is too terrible to communicate with Japanese people, thus, I've never talked to the original author about the rights.  I used some source codes which are gotten by simply right-click and "save as" (only a few changes on file path), and hope this won't make any unhappy trouble. :)
